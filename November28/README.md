I want to make a snow white with arms and a face

I want to give her a rotating waist perhaps with a gear and a stepper motor

her hands shouldn't be complex, but they need to be able to hold things (like a feather duster) and gesture

I want her face to be expressive, but I would prefer not to use a neopixel... maybe a neopixel mouth

I plan to hide elecrtical components under a large hoop skirt and connect a support structure to a base plate (shown in red)
