# Starting out / Ideation

- I began building this project with the original goal of making a compact, mobile, remote controlled robot with an incorporated breadboard so that I could add to/ adjust its components as I wished. 
  - Building the robot in this way left allowed me to be more iterative with my design process without having to deconstruct the robot each time my ideas changed. 
  - This did pressent some challenges however, as the original platform of my robot limited what components I was able to add.
  - Having this more limited framework allowed me to push the limits of my manufacturing abilities without going overboard.

- In Addition to the robot itself, I wanted to create a remote controll that I could reuse for other projects in the future. 

- The Assignment goal for this project was to create a robot that was expressive. 
  - From the beginning I had the intention of creating expression through some sort of mechanical movement, although the way in which this ultimately manifested was not what I originally expected. 
  - I originally planned to incorporate neopixel lights, other sensors, but changed this as my robot developed into a more stuctured form.

In the journal describe your idea for your robot.
You may use words and/or pictures (hand drawn is fine).
Describe how your robot is going to be expressive
