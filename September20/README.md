**Documentation!**

I decided to make my first robot for this class out of a Cereal box I had saved. Since the box had a chicken on it, I thought it should lay an egg. This idea developed as I built the robot, and I decided that instead of laying an egg, it should pour me some cereal. Chaos Ensued..

Not really it was actually quite an enjoyable build!

_Physical Description:_

- the bot is driven by 2 brushless DC motors and supported by a third wheel or skate, made out of a can of coke. A standard H-bridge drives the motors via an arduino Uno. 
- the cerial-despensing unit is in the middle of the box and powered by a large servo motor. It holds a small cardboard cup where stowage can be loaded.
- The eye of the chicken has been replaced with a large button that in the case of this robot, only acts as an indicator light to show that the robot is running. (I had originally tried to use this button to start the robot, but it was too unreliable and I was unable to make it work. If I were to continue working on this project, that would be my first order of buisness) 
- The Arduino is powered externally by a cable, But I would really like to be able to power it with an internal battery for greater mobility and reliability

_Problems_

- my main problem during this build was making sure All of my connections were tight. I will upload another video of a time when My light would turn on whenever a person got close to the robot (creepy!) I fixed this by using a simpler button and gluing more things down.
