## Prompt: 
> Choose a short scene from a play and a character in that scene, and consider how you would make a robot actor to perform that scene. Any spoken words will come from a human or a computer, not from your actor.


## Macduff receives the news that his family has been slaughtered. (Act 4, Scene 3)
[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJPG-bk_JAc)

The scene has three actors (Macduff, Ross, and Malcolm) which suggests I would need three robots to perform it. Three robots is a lot, so I think it is best to narrow down which characters really need to be represented as robots. Ultimately, Macduff  and his reaction to the horrible news that his family has been slaughtered are the focus of the scene. In other words, the main source of expression and emotion-- the meat of the scene (which could benefit from having a physical body) would be Macduff. The other two characters are rather flat and only serve to provide him with this information and set him up for his performance. They also act as part of his ego or conscience, especially with Malcom egging Macduff to get revenge. For this reason I would have Ross and Malcolm be represented via voice over, almost like they are characters in the mind of our main robot: Macduff. Perhaps they could be melded into one character, or the lights could change color depending on which one was speaking. 

With that as the framework for the performance, I can get into building Macduff, a robot that needs to have the ability to grieve the loss of his family and take up his sword in order to avenge them. 

*How would you build the actor?*
*What technical features will the actor need?*
*What sequence of moves or other actions will you give your actor so that they can best play the part?*

### There are a few things that I think must be visible in this scene. 
1. The beginning of the scene is rather mundane-- mostly the exchange of information. Macduff responds to the others with thoughts on how his county is falling apart, but remains composed.
- The robot needs to respond to information, verbally (through a microphone either on the robot itself or in a place where it could seem like it is coming from the robot)
- The robot needs to be capable of basic locomotion, perhaps on wheels, just so this part of the scene has some movement.
2. When Ross breaks the news that Macduff’s family has all been brutally murdered, Macduff breaks. He goes silent, withdraws (putting his cap over his eyes) and begins to weep.  
- Macduff-bot needs to respond to this information non-verbally. If the robot has a face of neopixels, or even a single dynamic LED, it would be possible to signal this gradual realization through a slow change in color 
- After this he turns away from the audience and covers his face with a cap. I would love it if the robot’s head could retract into its body, like in Wall-e (wall-e’s eyes retract into his body and he becomes a cube when he is scared). 
3. He asks again if it is true, then falls to the ground, going through the stages of grief in short succession. He cries and moans while giving his speech. 
- The robot’s head would pop out again to speak.
- The robot needs to cry. This could be done by making the robot mime tears either with hands over the face or lowering its head again. But I think it would be more interesting, and more indicative of the self-destruction that Macduff is feeling to have actual watery tears. I would do this by having a syringe inside the robot's head full of water. When the robot cries a small motor would press on the syringe, letting water drip down the face/ front side of the bot. 
4. While on the ground, Malcolm eggs him on, fostering his rage and telling him to get revenge. “Let grief convert to anger. Blunt not the heart; enrage it.” Malcom hands him the sword which he takes.
- I picture the sword, which in this case could be a gun or other weapon (futuristic robots and such), descending slowly from the ceiling on a string. 
- Macduff would need at least one hand or limb in order to take this weapon and raise it.
5. Macduff rises, sword drawn, fuming with the prospect of revenge.
- The robot doesn’t need to take the weapon off of the string, but does need to brandish it in some way. 

*How will you decorate or dress the actor for best effect?*
 
I think it would be really fun to dress up Macduff-bot like he was from the eleventh century with a little tunic- especially if the weapon was a sword.
