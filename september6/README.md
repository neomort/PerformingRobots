*Reading Response: Autonomous Robots as Performing Agents*

To start off I just want to list some key words and phrases from the reading. Each of them introduces a concept that the team who wrote the paper considered or implemented when considering their design process. I could probably write a long reaction to the way each of these terms was used This is a list I could potentially look back on in the future in order to help me brainstorming the functionality or design of my own future robot performance: 

- Simplicity
- Physical agents
- Behavioral model
- Physical presence = immediate rapport
- Explicit communication
- Autonomous 
- Puppet
- Communication types
  - Agent - Agent
  - Director - Agent (sometimes Agent - Director)
  - Agent - Audience (performance)


I was particularly fascinated by the detailed academic language this article uses to describe the process of creating a robotic puppet performance. Although it does seem silly at times, it does do a good job to clearly communicate the intention, inspiration, and process of the artists. 

One other thing about the paper I find very interesting is that it was written a whole 25 years ago. I think a lot of the value of this paper can be found in the fact that it is older, and many of the processes these artists and engineers are following are cutting edge. Things that may seem simple, logical, or essay to someone like me who has grown up his entire life with access to computers, small robots, and the internet were only just developing. It is almost like opening a time capsule.
